# Fighter-Jet-Comparsion
A very basic tool to compare performance of various fighters

This was an attempt of mine to use data and images available on the internet to produce plots to compare performance and various parameters of different fighter jets (namely Delta Canard configuration fighters. Rafale, Eurofighter, Gripen and Tejas Mk2).

However, since this is too simple and the aircraft related data might be off, the produced plots are not very realistic.

The goal behind this was to get to know more about fighters and try and create a simple technical comparison tool. I learnt about a concept called close coupled canards and how they improve lift, pitch, maneuverability and how the equation for close coupled canards allow for better mathematical results than the same for regular canards.

It takes in a speed and height from the user (again this shows how limited the code is since it can only do comparisons at a certain speed at a certain altitude, but the goal was not to build a super accurate comparison tool for military procurement personnel-lol, would be cool to build one down the line though).
